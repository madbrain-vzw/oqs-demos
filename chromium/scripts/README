These scripts help facilitate a build of PQC-enabled Chromium.
They have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 .

How to use :

1. Please set the PROJECT environment variable. This is the location where you
would like your Chromium build to be stored. For example, using bash :
export PROJECT=/home/madbrain/pqc_chromium

2. Make sure your user has sudo permissions, as this will be needed to install
optional packages.

3. If you want the script to run unattended, you may need to increase the
default sudo timeout. Use 
sudo visudo
Then change the timeout value. For example :
Defaults        timestamp_timeout=360

4. Review getpqc.sh and apply_patch.sh to make sure the Chromium tag and
corresponding OQS patch are current. If not, please update the files. The
following lines may need to be updated.

git checkout 94.0.4602.0
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/main/chromium/chromium94.patch
git apply ./chromium94.patch

5. Run master.sh to start the build . You will immediately be asked for sudo
authentication. Be prepared to wait several hours for the build to complete.
